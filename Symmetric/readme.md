# Demo Matrix Cipher source code
## Installation
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Encryption and Decryption
This use a fixed-length dummy binary string to demonstrate how Matrix Cipher work with plaintext and how I implemented the keygen (generate an invertible matrix in $\mathbb{Z}_m$).

```
python main.py
```
